Asteroids Too
2017-05-18

1. Which jobs are most crucial?
      The most crucial tasks are writing the movement code for moveable objects, asteroids, and the player's ship. 
	  This constitutes a basic working version.
2. Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
		Writing the moveable class and the player's ship class are the absolute core functionality because the 
		entirety of the game is dependent on player interaction and the movement code.
3. Which components are prerequisites for others?
      The movement class is a prerequisite for the asteroid class and the ship class. The player class and enemy
	  ship class are dependent on the ship class

4. Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
	  After working on the moveable class together, we can branch off into working on the ship class and the asteroid class.

5. What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?	
		5/24 - Have asteroids and player ship coded.
		5/26 - Have weapons system implemented
		5/30 - Have rudimentary enemy ships coded
		6/2 - Have power up system and inventory coded
		6/6 - Create enemy wave spawning function
		until 6/9 Polish up the code, create custom levels if time permits.
