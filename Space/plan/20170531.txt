Order of most important to least imporant

- Projectile system - Flesh it out
- Enemyships should be able to move without spazzing out and weirdly synchonizing with the player - Item above can be done simultaneously
- Ability to make a base that consists of walls and money storages. Storages increase the max money the player can hold, - Can be done simultaneously
  allowing the user to purchase more expensive things from the shop 
- Enemies that attack the base(with ArrayPriorityQueue based AI) 
- functional shop
- Wave based enemies
- GUI for the market
- Powerup system - thinking of getting rid of this due to time constraints.
