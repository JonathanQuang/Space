## Project Title: AsteroidsToo

## What is AsteroidsToo?
AsteroidsToo is a game programmed in java using Processing that is inspired by the classic arcade game asteroids. The player uses "a" 
and "d" to turn the ship left and right. "w" and "s" will tell the ship to accelerate forward or backward. Pressing e will cause the ship
to shoot. The player can shoot asteroids to earn money and to protect the central market/base from being destroyed. Money can be used
to purchase upgrades, weapons, walls, or storages to increase the maximum amount of money that can be held.
