- Asteroids that move -done
- Asteroid spawner -done
- Player that moves - Get done by end of tomorrow
- Projectile system - 5/24
- Player that can kill astroids - 5/24
- Asteroids that can die and give the player money -- 5/25, can be done independent of item below
- Central market/shop that the player must defend, doesn't have any function except for existing -- 5/25
- Ability to make a base that consists of walls and money storages. Storages increase the max money the player can hold,
  allowing the user to purchase more expensive things from the shop --5/30, this will probably take a long time
- Enemies that attack the base(with ArrayPriorityQueue based AI)  --6/1, the above task must be done before hand
- Switching different weapons ( Double Linked List ) -- 6/2, can be done independently, though the above items are of
  higher priority
- functional shop -- 6/2, same reason as above applies
- Wave based enemies - 6/3
